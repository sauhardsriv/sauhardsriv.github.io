7:T4e4,Emerging economies, even those with considerable external debt, hold substantial amounts in foreign exchange (FX) reserves. This paper identifies a distinct channel through which financial market frictions explain why net external debtor economies might prefer maintaining reserves to reducing their external debt. In a small open economy with free capital mobility and financial frictions, the model shows that the central bank optimally maintains FX reserves instead of reducing the economy’s external debt. This is because reserve operations influence the exchange rate; specifically, reserve accumulation depreciates the exchange rate, diluting the real value of existing debt payments and minimizing resource losses. Furthermore, the model shows that the optimal reserve accumulation policy under commitment is time-inconsistent as the central bank faces incentives to mitigate the external debt burden. A time-consistent equilibrium features even greater reserve accumulation. Finally, a quantitative analysis of the model demonstrates that in the presence of volatile capital flows, the economy optimally maintains a portfolio of external debt and foreign reserves with FX interventions stabilizing the exchange rate and smoothing consumption.8:T523,The persistent variation among Indian states in per-capita value added from manufacturing sector raises the question whether the long-run equilibrium in the manufacturing sector differs across states. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence on whether labour disputes in the form of strikes, lockouts, temporary closure etc., have caused any variation in these equilibria for the recent period. Available data suggests that in 9 out of 16 states in our sample, labour disputes have generally reduced between 2001 and 2017, while in others labour disputes mostly characterised as random shocks with little predictability. Our two-stage least squares estimates using states’ election cycles as instrument for the labour disputes suggest that these labour disputes with little persistence did not have much influence over the inter-state differences in the equilibrium capital-labour ratios in “registered” manufacturing units between 2001 and 2017. However, 1 percent increase in labour disputes might be associated with 3.2 percent reduction in total factor productivity for the sector in states where disputes were random events. In the remaining states, where labour disputes have consistently fallen over time, this effect is significantly reduced. Our findings are robust in different sample of firms.0:{"P":null,"b":"ZTnjlNVkY8l8f9Uw-bFVR","p":"","c":["","research"],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["research",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/bd0fa81100605b61.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","link","1",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/860a77e8b4e024b3.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","suppressHydrationWarning":true,"children":["$","body",null,{"className":"__className_39bb6c","children":["$","$L2",null,{"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L5",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[],["$","$L6",null,{}]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}]}]}]}]]}],{"children":["research",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","research","children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L5",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["__PAGE__",["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","article",null,{"className":"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-8 pt-8 pb-8","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-primary-text dark:text-dark-text text-[24px] font-semibold mb-6","children":"Research"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-8","children":[["$","section",null,{"className":"bg-primary-main dark:bg-dark-surface shadow-md rounded-lg p-6 text-primary-text dark:text-dark-text","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-[20px] font-semibold mb-3","children":"Working Papers"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"list-disc ml-6 space-y-6 text-[16px] font-normal","children":[["$","li",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[["$","p",null,{"children":[" Financial Frictions, FX Reserves, and Exchange Rate Management in Emerging Economies "," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"/papers/reserves2024.pdf","className":"text-primary-url dark:text-dark-url hover:text-primary-url-hover dark:hover:text-dark-url-hover ml-2 font-semibold","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"[PDF]"}]," "]}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"list-disc ml-6 space-y-1 text-sm text-primary-text dark:text-dark-text opacity-70 dark:opacity-70 font-normal","children":["$","li",null,{"children":["$","span",null,{"className":"italic","children":"Revise & Resubmit- Journal of International Economics.

A transition to net zero appreciates the currency by lowering the import bill for fossil fuels, but depreciates the currency by making domestic tradables more expensive. We calibrate the model to the case of Japan and find that the transition to net zero lowers consumption by 0.2-2%."}]}]]}]]}]}]]}]]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"bg-primary-main dark:bg-dark-surface shadow-md rounded-lg p-6 text-primary-text dark:text-dark-text","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-[20px] font-semibold mb-3","children":"Publications"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"list-disc ml-6 space-y-6 text-[16px] font-normal","children":[["$","li",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[["$","p",null,{"children":["  "," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://doi.org/10.1108/IGDR-11-2022-0130","className":"text-primary-url dark:text-dark-url hover:text-primary-url-hover dark:hover:text-dark-url-hover ml-2 font-semibold","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"Productivity and real exchange rates for India: does Balassa-Samuelson effect explain?"}]," ","(with Saurabh Ghosh & Siddhartha Nath)"]}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"list-disc ml-6 space-y-1 text-sm text-primary-text dark:text-dark-text opacity-70 dark:opacity-70 font-normal","children":["$","li",null,{"children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"italic","children":"Indian Growth and Development Review.
